# CS 255 Portfolio – DriverPass Project

This repository contains selected portfolio projects from CS 255: System Analysis and Design.
The documents demonstrate my ability to gather business requirements and design a system based on user needs.

## Project Summary
The DriverPass project was created for a client named DriverPass. The client wanted a system to help students better prepare for their driving exams. The system needed to allow students to schedule driving lessons, access online learning materials, and take practice tests. The system also included roles for instructors, administrators, and IT staff.

## What I Did Well
I did a good job breaking down the system into clear user roles and use cases. I also clearly showed how each actor interacts with the system using UML diagrams. My system design matched the business requirements and stayed focused on what the users needed.

## What I Would Improve
If I could revise one part of my work, I would improve the level of detail in some of the UML diagrams. I would add more alternate paths and error handling to better show how the system reacts when something goes wrong.

## Understanding User Needs
I interpreted the user’s needs by carefully reviewing the interview transcript and identifying what each type of user needed to do in the system. Considering user needs is important because the system must be easy to use and actually solve the user’s problem. If user needs are ignored, the system may not be useful even if it works correctly.

## My Software Design Approach
When designing software, I start by understanding the problem and identifying the users. I then break the system into smaller parts using use cases and diagrams. In the future, I will continue using techniques like requirement analysis, UML diagrams, and user-focused design to build systems that meet real needs.
