**CS 255 Portfolio – DriverPass Project

**This repository includes portfolio work from CS 255: System Analysis and Design. The documents in this repository show my work on gathering business requirements and designing a system that meets user needs.

**Project Summary

**The DriverPass project was created for a client called DriverPass. The goal of the system was to help students prepare for their driving exams. The system allows students to schedule driving lessons, access online learning materials, and take practice tests. The system also supports different user roles, including instructors, administrators, and IT staff.

**What I Did Well

**One thing I did well was breaking the system down into clear user roles and use cases. This made it easier to understand what each type of user needed to do in the system. I also used UML diagrams to show how users interact with the system. Overall, my system design stayed aligned with the business requirements.

**What I Would Improve

**If I could revise one part of my work, I would improve the level of detail in some of the UML diagrams. I would add more alternate paths and show how the system handles errors or unexpected situations. This would make the diagrams more complete and easier to understand.

**Understanding User Needs

**I interpreted the user’s needs by carefully reviewing the interview transcript and identifying the tasks each user needed to perform. Considering user needs is important because the system must be easy to use and actually solve the problem it was designed for. If user needs are not considered, the system may work technically but still fail to meet expectations.

**My Software Design Approach

**When designing software, I start by understanding the problem and identifying who the users are. I then break the system into smaller parts using use cases and diagrams. In the future, I plan to continue using requirement analysis and UML diagrams to design systems that focus on user needs and clear functionality.
